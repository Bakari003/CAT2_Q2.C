i. Array Data Structure:
An array is a data structure that holds a fixed number of elements of the same data type. It stores elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing quick access via indices. Arrays can be one-dimensional (like a list) or multi-dimensional (like a table or matrix).

ii.
2D array declaration and initialization
scores = [
    [65, 84],
    [92, 78],
    [85, 59],
    [70, 67]
]

iii. Print the Elements of the Array Using a Nested For Loop:

Hereâ€™s how you can use a nested loop to print each element:

# Loop through rows
for i in range(len(scores)):
    # Loop through columns
    for j in range(len(scores[i])):
        print(scores[i][j], end=" ")
    print()  # Newline after each row

Expected Output:

65 84 
92 78 
85 59 
70 67

This code prints each element in scores row by row. The end=" " argument ensures elements in a row are printed on the same line, and print() after each row moves to the next line.
